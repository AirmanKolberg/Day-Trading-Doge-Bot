# Day-Trading Crypto Bot
This is a little script I worked on using the robin_stocks API (as well as the IEX Cloud API, but that didn't turn out well) for day-trading Dogecoin (or other cryptos) through RobinHood.  Through this simple script, I was able to turn a very small amount of crypto to a very large one, so I wanted to share my progress so that others may see or even use.  Again, just something I did on the side- I know nothing about day trading.  This was just for 'funzies', as I imagine the kids say.  Just don't forget to `pip install -r requirements.txt` before taking on `main.py`.  Have a good one!

PS - In case you didn't know, the stock market, some cryptos, etc., is all a legal Ponzi scheme.  Gamble at your own risk, or better yet- don't do it at all.  But, if you've got some money to spare and you want to have some fun, go wild.
